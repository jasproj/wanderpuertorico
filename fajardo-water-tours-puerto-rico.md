## Bio Bay Kayak Tours

### Glowing Bio Bay Kayak Adventure

Paddle into Laguna Grande after sunset and watch the water ignite with blue-green light. Every stroke, every splash, every fish darting beneath your kayak triggers the bioluminescent dinoflagellates. It's like kayaking through liquid stars.

Small groups (usually 10-12 kayaks) keep the experience intimate. Guides share the science behind the glow while leading you through mangrove channels to the main lagoon.

## Pro Tips for Fajardo Water Tours

1. **Stay nearby:** Tours depart early. Book a hotel in Fajardo or nearby Luquillo to avoid the 1-hour drive from San Juan at dawn.
2. **Combine activities:** Morning snorkel + evening bio bay makes for an epic water-focused day.
3. **Check the weather:** East coast tours cancel in high winds or swells. Have a backup plan.
4. **Book direct:** Local operators offer better prices than third-party booking sites, and your money stays in Puerto Rico.
5. **Bring cash:** Some smaller operators don't take cards on the boat for tips or extras.
