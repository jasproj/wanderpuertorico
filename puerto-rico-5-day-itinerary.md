No passport needed. No currency exchange. Your cell phone works. Let's go.

## Day 1: Arrive + Old San Juan

**Morning:** Land at SJU, grab your rental car (you'll need it), check into your San Juan hotel.

**Afternoon:** Walk the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan. Hit the essentials:
- **Castillo San Felipe del Morro** — 16th-century fortress with Atlantic views
- **La Fortaleza** — Governor's mansion, oldest in the Western Hemisphere
- **Calle del Cristo** — Colorful street, great photos

**Evening:** Dinner in Old San Juan. Try mofongo (mashed plantains) at a local spot. Walk the paseo along the water as the city lights up.

**Stay:** San Juan (Condado or Old San Juan)

## Day 2: El Yunque Rainforest

**Morning:** Early start for El Yunque (45 min drive). Beat the clouds and crowds.

**Book a tour or DIY:**

## Day 3: Culebra Island Day Trip
